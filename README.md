### E-Commerce Website

E-commerce web application helps the user purchase the products using various selections. It shows available items depending on the inventory. When the user clicks on the product, the user can view the product details and, this page also has a "Add to Cart" button. Users can add the products to the cart page and they can place the order/remove the product from the cart whenever they want. Then the user can do a payment transaction to place the order.

This website is implemented by using the Django framework and SQLite Database and only authorized users can login to this website.
